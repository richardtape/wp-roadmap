Display a roadmap for your projects and allow others to suggest ideas.

== Description ==

WP-Roadmap allows you to create a public, private, or semi-private roadmap for your projects. You're able to categorize
each roadmap item and allow users to filter by them on the front-end of your site. Each roadmap item has statuses which
allow you to inform your audience how you're progressing with each item.

* Built-in roadmap or individual roadmap item templates
* Allow users to submit ideas
* Users can search or look at types of roadmap items
* Give statuses to each roadmap item (Proposed, Researching, Implementing, Testing, Completed, Rejected)
* Upcoming add-ons (see the roadmap - hah! - at [https://richardtape.com/plugins/wp-roadmap/roadmap/](https://richardtape.com/plugins/wp-roadmap/roadmap/ "The wp-roadmap roadmap") )
